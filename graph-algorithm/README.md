## Dynamic Programming Algorithm

### Bellman Ford
Bellman Ford is a dynamic programming algorithm to find single source the shortest path on a
directed weighted graph.This works well if there is a negative weight edge.
This is done by relaxation method , relaxing all the edges and computing the path.
Time Complexity is O(VE) . In case of complete graph the time complexity is O(n^3).
This is used to detect cycles in weighted directed graph.

DisAdvantage:
This wouldn't work if there is a cycle with total weight is negative.
